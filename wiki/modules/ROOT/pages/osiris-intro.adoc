# An Introduction to OSIRIS Scripting

## What the heck is OSIRIS?

Osiris is a proprietary programming language developed and used by Larian Studios.
It's the primary language used to implement game logic. 
You can think of the game world as an otherwise static object, with Osiris being the tool used to influence it.

Osiris is a bit different to programming languages you might be used to.
Unlike say, Java or Python, Osiris is a _declarative_ language.
This means it's highly abstract, with code focussing more on what is supposed to happen rather than how to implement it.

This abstraction is due to the fact Osiris relies almost entirely on API connections to the Divinity Engine (what BG3 is built on).
These connections let Osiris code know what's going on in the game world, and influence the game world in return.
There's 3 kinds of API connection:

. https://docs.baldursgate3.game/index.php?title=Category:Osiris_Queries[Queries] - Asking about the state of the world
. https://docs.baldursgate3.game/index.php?title=Category:Osiris_Calls[Calls] - Changing the state of the world

The entire logic for a game is one big program, called a _story_.
The story is then broken down into smaller sections, called _goals_.
A goal is a section a logic that deals with related game events.
For instance, everything that happens in the fight outside the Emerald Grove in Act 1 is handled by one goal.

Goals are related to each other in a hierarchy.
A goal can have sub-goals, and those sub goals can only start if their parent goal has finished running.
Specifically, it must have executed the `GoalCompleted` action.
For instance, the Act 2 goals cannot start until their parent goal has confirmed the player has entered Act 2.

## Modifying the Story

IMPORTANT: The following sections assume you are using the Baldur's Gate 3 Modding Toolkit.

You can find the story for the current project by clicking the *Story Editor* button in the top toolbar:

This will open the Story Editor in a separate window.
On the left side you will be able to see all the goals for the current story.

You can double click on a goal to open it.
The goals with an arrow button next to them have sub-goals.
Click on this arrow to expand the list.

NOTE: You may have noticed a lot of goals begin with underscores.
This is because Osiris executes goals in alphabetical order.
If there is a procedure you want to use in across goals, it must be defined before you use it.
By placing these definitions in goals with underscores, you can ensure these goals are executed first.

## Structure of a Goal

A goal consists of 3 sections.
These are shown in the Story Editor by the 3 text panes.

### Init

The `INIT` section runs as soon as the goal is initialised.
A goal is initialised when it's parent goal finishes.

### Knowledge Base (KB)

The `KB` section consists of _rules_.
A rule is a logical statement structured as an `IF ... THEN` code block.
For example:

```
IF
Trigger Condition <1>
AND
Extra Condition <2>
THEN
Action1;
Action2; <3>
```

<1> The rule will wait until the trigger condition is met before executing the `THEN` block.
A trigger condition can be an event, or detecting something has been added to a xref:osiris-syntax.adoc#databases[database].

<2> Rules can have multiple conditions to meet before they execute. 
There's slightly more freedom after the first condition, you can xref:osiris-syntax#queries[query] the game engine, use a xref:osiris-syntax#comparisons[comparison], or check something is in a xref:osiris-syntax.adoc#databases[database].

<3> After all the triggers have been met, the actions are executed.
An action could be a xref:osiris-syntax.adoc#calls[call], running a xref:osiris-syntax.adoc#procedures[procedure], editing a xref:osiris-syntax.adoc#databases[database], or finishing a goal.
Note that actions end with a semicolon.

These rules become _active_ - i.e. can be executed - once the parent goal finishes, similar to the `INIT` section.

WARNING: An event can only be used as the first trigger condition.
You can't have multiple events as triggers, or place an event after and `AND`.
Doing this will result in a build error.

### Exit

The `EXIT` section runs after the goal has executed the `GoalCompleted` action.
