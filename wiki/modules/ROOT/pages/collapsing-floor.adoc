# Making a Collapsing Floor

WIP

A common trap in D&D is the hidden pit.
The mechanism is quite simple - a character walks over a weak floor, it breaks, and they fall into the pit.

Unfortunately this kind of trap is quite rare in BG3.

## The Pit

We're going to start by creating the pit.
This will look different depending on your environment, but in general just just need to make a fairly steep hole in the ground.
Refer to xref::landscaping.adoc[landscaping] for information on how to edit terrain. 

For context here's what my testing level looks like:

## The Floor

Let's make the object that will collapse into the pit when the player walks on it.
This will be a level template, as its AI grid is stored separately from the level it is in.
This allows us to add and remove a walkable surface from the world, which lets the player fall into the pit.

### Creating the Floor Itself

Create a new level using kbd:[Ctrl+N]. 
I recommend always starting with `Basic_Level_A`. 
Name the level what you want to call the platform object.

Place down a single walkable object.
In my case, I chose `BLD_GEN_Scaffolding_Wood_B_Platform_A`.

This platform is a xref:entity-types.adoc#_scenery[scenery] object - meaning it's static within the world.
This means it's added the the AI grid - and the player can walk over it like anything else in the level.
Make sure the `Walk On` attribute is the sidebar is checked, and add an AI seeder on top of it to instantiate the AI grid.
Delete everything else in the level except the seeder and platform (this includes the light probe and start triggers).
Enter the game in game mode to make sure the character can walk around fine.

### Adding this Floor to Our Level

We're now going to turn this platform into a xref:entity-types.adoc#_level_templates[Level Template].
In the top toolbar, click Level -> Edit Level Data.

Ensure the `Is Platform` checkbox is selected.
This setting will allow the platform to move around and disappear - and have the AI grid update to reflect this.

Now select the root templates menu.
Click the Create New image:pit_create_new_button.png[25, 25] button in the top left to open the Create Object Wizard:

. Ensure the `Select Mod` dropdown is set to your mod (it should be set to this by default).
. Set the `Select Type` dropdown to Level Template.
. Set the `Source Level` field to the name of the level.
. Set the `Name` field also to the name of the level.

Click `Create`.

Return to the level where the trap will be.
Open the root templates menu, select your mod in the file menu, and place the new level template.
